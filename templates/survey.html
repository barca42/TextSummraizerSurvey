    <h1>Comparative Analysis of Text Summarizers</h1>
    <h2>Explanation for Participants:</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Dear Participants, </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your interest in participating in my questionnaire on text summarization. The purpose of this questionnaire is to compare the performance of three different text summarization models. Text summarization is a vital task in natural language processing that involves condensing large bodies of text into shorter, more manageable summaries while retaining key information.
            <br>In this questionnaire, you will be presented with several sets of original texts along with summaries generated by each of the three summarization models. Your task will be to evaluate and compare these summaries based on several criteria, including accuracy, coherence, and relevance to the original text.
            <br>Your feedback will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each summarization model, which can be instrumental in further improving text summarization technology.
            <br>The participation in this research is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. There will be no personal data collected and it is entirely anonymous.
            <br> The data used in this questionnaire is randomly collected from Reddit. The text provided is for evaluation purposes only, and there is no intended message or bias associated with it.
        </p>

        <p> Thank you for your participation and valuable contribution to the research.</p>
