1,"Want to end my engagement, engaged for five years and together for seven. We are not married. He is ten years older than me. He earns far more than me, we are both doctors but I have been part time for the majority of the time I’ve known him due to anxiety and depression related to him and what I was coerced into (eg where I was naively forced to live in his mothers house very far away from my workplace and had no car so had to rely on very bad public transport which often made me late). We have a two year old so I also lost on on salary during maternity leave and also lost out on salary because he won’t let me work until she’s in nursery and he won’t allow nursery until she’s 3 years old. I want to leave the house, but I need to go back to work and save up money to rent somewhere. Both our names are on the property as joint owners but he is the only one who pays the mortgage because I can’t afford it. What am I entitled to? Would he pay child support? What about if custody is 50/50 would I still get child support? We are both in UK. His salary is 120k and he has 70k savings. I have no savings and my salary when I go back to work is 37k. Don’t know what to do because he won’t let me go to work until she’s in nursery but he won’t allow her in nursery until she’s 3 years old","I want to leave the house, but I need to go back to work and save up money to rent somewhere.

2,"Hey all, I've got an interview for the role of Food Services Assistant this coming Wednesday. However, I have had many interviews before with Sainsbury's, but have never gotten a job there. I have autism and I really don't perform well in interviews. Do you think this is worth telling the store that I've applied for? I get stuck with the interview questions and often don't know what to say. Do you think I'd be allowed to bring notes into the interview? Also, what does a typical day look like as a Food Services Assistant? The job I applied for has kind of late shifts finishing at 9pm sometimes. What kind of tasks would I be doing at around 6pm to 9pm? I assume the café doesn't stay open that late? Thanks all.","I get stuck with the interview questions and often don't know what to say.

3,"My boyfriend and I (18 and 19) managed to finally get a flat in Edinburgh as I was doing uni at Napier University, however I ultimately decided that uni isnt really for me and dropped out recently. Were now in our Edinburgh flat which is far too expensive for just us after our flatmate bailing on us. Were wanting to move to Fife, maybe Dunfermline as my boyfriend works in South Queensferry. I grew up in Fife however I've never rented there. Does anyone have any tips or things that will help us secure a flat there? I'm more concerned about what documents and other things the letting agencies require you to give them as we've only had this flat for about 3 months. Any companies to avoid? Would also appreciate any private landlord connections or anything.","My boyfriend and I (18 and 19) managed to finally get a flat in Edinburgh as I was doing uni at Napier University, however I ultimately decided that uni isnt really for me and dropped out recently.

4,"For some context, I am a 17 year old female and a sixth form student, I study History, Psychology and English Literature and I am particularly interested in studying Psychology at a University once I finish sixth form. I really want to help people, especially the ones that are struggling and make sure they know they aren’t alone. However, I, myself, am a big over-thinker and I find myself always worrying about every little thing and I’m scared that doing a job related to psychology will overwhelm me eventually.

5,"I am currently averaging three classes per week. I do not feel like this is acceptable given the £9,250 in tuition fees that we pay. I was expecting to do a lot of independent study but I was not expecting the university to give the absolute bare minimum. People on other courses at my university have well in excess of 15 hours of class time per week. Is this lack of class time standard for law degrees or is my school just really poor?","People on other courses at my university have well in excess of 15 hours of class time per week.

7,"We recently moved house and during the moving process we were told by virgin that our previous internet speeds (m250) were available at the address and that we could definitely connect to the internet using virgin. Fast forward to the day of installation and we call to confirm what time they'd be over only to be told that it's been cancelled and that the house isn't servicable at all by virgin with the reason being 'there is a concrete wall' that they cannot get the wiring through. Can't see any concrete walls nearby and our house is made of bricks. We moved to this house with a condition that the internet was high speed due to both of us working from home with roles that require high speeds. Anyone know if there's anything we can do at all? UPDATE: Ended up having to get starlink in the end which is actually faster than the package we had with virgin media. Thanks for all the help and advice given, hope other people don't have to go through the hassle I went through with virgin media.","We recently moved house and during the moving process we were told by virgin that our previous internet speeds (m250) were available at the address and that we could definitely connect to the internet using virgin.

8,"Hi - Hoping someone can help me figure out this bug as the Adobe chat has been useless. I just downloaded the Photoshop beta app in my Creative Cloud desktop app. Ever since whenever I open any app I get this alert every 20 mins. If I click 'learn more' it takes me to a webpage telling me to upgrade my subscription (which I ignore) and I can go back to using the app. Yes I pay for full suite every month $55 and I only have one or sometimes a second device activated. In the past if I had a third device on - it would prompt me to deactivate one of them. Other than really annoying not sure what else to do. I changed password, upgraded all softwares, have only one device activated and restarted...","I just downloaded the Photoshop beta app in my Creative Cloud desktop app. I changed password, upgraded all softwares, have only one device activated and restarted...","Installed Photoshop beta app in Creative Cloud, only have one device activated and restarted.

9,"Hey, I have been thinking about starting to build my cv this summer and I thought about doing a law internship, although I’m still not in uni. I heard that other people do this but when I told my mother about it she said “are you just gonna be scanning documents?” (Ironically). My mother has a good network and I could shadow or intern with one of her lawyer friends or, I have also talked with a friends dad which is the national director of Private Banking at an international bank and he told me I could “assist” him for a month in the summer, just for the experience and cv. My questions are, What would I be doing in a pre-uni law internship? Is it worth it? Should I take the Private Banking opportunity although it’s not 100% related to law? Thank you! Edit: Thank you everyone for all the help! In all honesty, it is much more clear to me now what I should do.","Hey, I have been thinking about starting to build my cv this summer and I thought about doing a law internship, although I’m still not in uni.

10,"Recently attended an interview at High Street Law firm for an entry level paralegal role . They asked me the question “what should never be included in client files”. This question threw me off completely. My mind immediately thought this question was regarding Data Protection and GDPR. I asked to return to the question later on as they suggested at the beginning of the interview. My final answer was any sensitive information regarding other client cases/sensitive data/ protected characteristics. I found the question a little vague and it really stressed me out. I didn’t get the role and the interviewer made me aware that this was a “reversed question” meant to see if I would challenge their thinking/ stand up for myself as everything regarding a clients case should be included in their file. This has really confused me as I’ve never received a “trick question” before. Has anyone received a question like this before and how should I have answered this. Ps: my answer was regarded not completely correct as they wanted me to say nothing frankly.","I didn’t get the role and the interviewer made me aware that this was a “reversed question” meant to see if I would challenge their thinking/ stand up for myself as everything regarding a clients case should be included in their file.

11,"Feeling a wee bit rough today after a typical British Saturday night out. Visits to several pubs and probably in the region of twelve pints consumed, topped off with a curry on the way home. But while we were sitting in one of the pubs watching the Italians beat Scotland at rugby, we got talking about how different drinking cultures are on the continent. Belgian beer is served in half pints, the French prefer wine in small glasses, Germans enjoy table beer... And, in many places, it's culturally anathema to be visibly drunk in public. That old observation about 'they only have bouncers in Maccies in the UK, and places which get invaded by British tourists' also came into play. So, where did this binge drinking culture come from? I suggested it's some kind of rejection of, or at least response to, temperance movements; my lass reckons it's got more to do with a cultural nihilism - that we drink for oblivion. But what do you think?","But while we were sitting in one of the pubs watching the Italians beat Scotland at rugby, we got talking about how different drinking cultures are on the continent.

12,"My wife never, and I mean NEVER, uses logic in her daily life. What is something your partner does that drives you mad? On our food shop, she will pick everything up as per her list. NOT what items are grouped together in each aisle. So bread was the top of the list, and tortilla wraps were near the bottom. So she doubled back. Once, I can forgive. She does 20 times because all of her items are all over the place. I have explained why this doubled her time shopping, but she never does any different. There are many, many, MANY other examples of illogical behaviour.","She does 20 times because all of her items are all over the place.

13,"What British thing is considered more posh by foreigners than by actual British people? To give you an example, the whole tea drinking thing. Say the words tea time and a lot of us Americans imagine some Victorian club full of mustachioed gentlemen being waited on by servants, or a bunch of ladies in frilly dresses and giant hats in a well-kept English garden on a fancy Victorian estate. Yep, we get that from the movies. Most of us won't think of some regular guy drinking tea out of a metal thermos in his work van, and are only vaguely aware that tea is universal across the board.

The only time I've ever really been happy was when I was travelling around the UK perimeter and documenting it online.

15,"A woman got on the tube with a couple of lovely bunches of flowers. I smiled while I was looking at them thinking how nice they were, she clocked me smiling and smiled at me, I smiled back and thought nothing more of it. As I got to the top of the escalator at Brixton she was waiting there, and she said - I noticed you smiling at the flowers, they are from an event I was at and I want you to have them. What she didn’t know is that my Granny died a couple of days ago, we were very close, and I’d spent the day with my mum going through her things. A tough, shitty, horrible day with lots of tears. And this random woman’s small but kind gesture felt like the most overwhelming, unbelievable and soul rebuilding moment I’ve had in a really, really long time. So thank you, lovely stranger.
